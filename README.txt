hi folks,i was searching the forums for a slope class that works with flixel 2.5 but couldn't find any. so i decided to try it on my own.good for me there was already plenty of work done by fefranca and rybar in this thread: http://flixel.org/forums/index.php?topic=943.0my intention was to have a class that extends FlxTilemap and is able to handle collisions against slope tiles. the result looks good enough for me to share it with you.let me know if you have any suggestions for improvement.feel free to change or copy the code to use it with your own projects.
